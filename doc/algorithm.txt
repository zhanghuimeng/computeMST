A T-exchange is a pair of edges e, f where e e T,/. T, and T-e U]’ is a spanning tree. The weight o]’ exchange e,
f is w(f)- w(e). So the weight of tree T-e Uf is the weight of tree T plus the
weight of exchange e, [.

T-exchange

Theorem: spanning tree with the next smallest weight is T - e + f, where (e, f) is a minimum weight T-exchange. This observation is the basis of the algorithm.

Algorithm:
EX:
EX finds a minimum weight T-exchange e, f subject to certain constraints, IN, OUT.
We call an edge g eligible if a minimum weight exchange (g, h) has not been found.
1. all edges in T are eligible
2. a list L contains all edges in G, sorted in increasing weight
3. for each edge h
